# PCD_Registration

This is a ros package that register 2 pointclouds with using either Generalized Iterative Closest Point, which is I recommend, or Normal Distrubiton Transform algorithms.

## Requirements
- [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
- [PCL Library](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/)

## Build

```
cd ${workspace}/src
git clone https://github.com/yvzksgl/PCD_Registration.git
cd $[workspace}
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## Launch
You may want to change algorithm that will be applied. To do that you need to alter launch file.
```
parameters=[{"input_pcd1_path":"data/capture0001.pcd"},
                        {"input_pcd2_path":"data/capture0002.pcd"},
                        {"out_pcd_path":"data/transformed.pcd"},
                        {"algorithm": "gicp"}]
```
Only "gicp" and "ndt" allowed for algorithm parameter. To launch program as pre-configured:
```
ros2 launch pcd_reg pcd_reg.launch.py
```
## Results
Both of the results, green illustrates source pointcloud, red illustrates target pointclud and blue illustrates output pointcloud.
